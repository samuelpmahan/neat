# neat

`neat` is a small repo-local project ledger for agent-assisted work. Git owns history; Tidy owns lineage and promotion; product PCRs own detailed execution. Neat stores declared work and references those facts without copying or inventing them.

Install it in a project, then keep one JSON item at `.neat/items/<id>.json` and optional resolved facts at `.neat/facts.json`.

```sh
neat check
neat next
neat board
neat update DS-04 --expect <item-content-fingerprint> --patch claim.json
```

`check` validates local item shape. `next` reports locally available queued work and active claims. `board` writes one Markdown board and Mermaid graph from one PxC/PQL run. `update` locks and rereads only the addressed item, checks its content fingerprint, writes a sibling temporary file, then atomically replaces that item. It cannot edit requirements, checkpoints, execution, acceptance, or promotion records.

An item targets an existing Calculation (`fn.*`), Tick (`tick.*` plus its composition/name), or PCR (`pcr.*`). It is not a second task hierarchy. A shared Calculation’s board impact is derived from the named composition’s `Ticks[].Calculations[]`.

The checked-in DiscStudio fixture is intentionally synthetic. Run only the ordinary unit tests to inspect it; it does not claim any DiscStudio execution, Sam acceptance, or Tidy promotion.

After this checkpoint is accepted, its runnable board command is:

```sh
node dist/src/cli.js board --root fixtures/discstudio
```

## Boundaries

- Execution/inspection, verification, human acceptance, and Tidy promotion are separate predicates.
- A human acceptance must be explicitly recorded with its source; tests and agents cannot create it.
- Neat does not run product tests, render product output, or call Tidy promotion.
- The standalone Tidy promotion receipt is not available yet, so neat only preserves external promotion references.
